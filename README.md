A portfolio webpage

<p>This is my own webpage where I will display the work that I have done so far.</p>

<h3>Developing</h3>
<p>I started working with node.js and pug.js as a template engine. The reason for that was because I wanted to get more experience working with node and I saw the possibility to evolve the site in the future. My webhosting company however didnt have any support for node aplications so I used regular html instead. I have uploaded the node version of the page as well.</p>

<h3>Dependency</h3>
<p>For the node version of the page I have used different dependencys like: body-parser, express and pug</p>
